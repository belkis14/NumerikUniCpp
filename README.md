# Numerical Methods Assignments

This repository contains a collection of assignments and projects I completed while studying **Numerical Methods** during the summer of 2024. The topics span various core techniques and algorithms used to solve mathematical problems numerically, implemented in Python and/or MATLAB.

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Root-finding methods (Bisection, Newton-Raphson, Secant)
- Linear systems of equations (Gaussian Elimination, LU Decomposition)
- Interpolation (Lagrange, Newton, Spline)
- Numerical Integration (Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson’s Rule)
- Numerical Differentiation
- Ordinary Differential Equations (Euler’s Method, Runge-Kutta Methods)
- Error analysis and stability

## 📁 Structure

Each folder contains:
- `problem_description.pdf` or `.md`: Assignment description
- `solution.py` / `solution.m`: My implementation
- `report.pdf` (if available): Explanation of the method and results

## 🛠️ Tools & Languages

- Python (NumPy, Matplotlib, etc.)
- MATLAB
- Jupyter Notebooks

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/numerical-methods-assignments.git
   cd numerical-methods-assignments
